  <p class="BegDesc">The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at
    the online services provider CompuServe led by American computer scientist Steve Wilhite and released on 15 June
    1987. It has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability
    between applications and operating systems. </p>

  <h2>
    The Usage of Gifs
  </h2>
  <p class="BegDesc">
    Gifs are extremely popular in today's society. They are suitable for sharp-edged line art with a limited number of
    colors, such as logos. This takes advantage of the format's lossless compression, which favors flat areas of uniform
    color with well defined edges. They can also be used to store low-color sprite data for games.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <p class="listDesc">GIFs can be used for
      small animations and low-resolution video clips, or as reactions in online messaging used to convey emotion and
      feelings instead of using words. They are popular on social media platforms such as:</p>
    <li>Facebook</li>
    <li>Instagram</li>
    <li>Reddit</li>
    <li>Twitter</li>
  </ul>

    <p id="notfirstGif">This is the first Gif I've made using After Effects, I ended up really enjoying the process of
      making it and I like the end product.

  <h2>History of Gifs</h2>
  <p class="BegDesc">
    CompuServe introduced GIF on 15 June 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas. Gif
    became more popular than this because it was more efficient than the old format in addition to the fact that it was
    limited to black and white.
