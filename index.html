  <h2>History of Gifs</h2>
  <p class="BegDesc">
    The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a bitmap image format that was developed by CompuServe. The team who made the project was led by a computer scientist named Steve Wilhite and was released on 15 June
    1987. It has spread all around the world and become extremely popular.
    <br>
    <br>The company made GIF in order to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas. It
    became more popular than their old encoding format because it was more efficient than the old format in addition to the fact that it was
    limited to black and white.
    <br>
    <br>
    Due to CompuServe encouraging more and more companies to adopt the usage of Gif, it was one of the first two image formats commonly used on Websites, the other image format used was black-and-white XBM.
